    <h1>Formula 1 2018 Season</h1>
    <h2>What is Formula 1?</h2>
    <p>Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950.
    The "formula" in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (French for "grand prizes" or "great prizes"), which are held worldwide on purpose-built circuits and public roads.

<p>The 2018 Formula One season has been a close, pulsating and up-and-down challenge by two all time greats going for their fifth world drivers' championship.
   It has been the best and most dramatic season for some years. Ferrari appear to have finally ended the outright dominance of Mercedes in creating a package - and an engine - that seems to have the better of the Silver Arrows. There have been mistakes from drivers and teams that have cost vital championship points.  It has been unpredictable and riveting.
   There has been controversy, with Ferrari and Mercedes drivers colliding on track which led to questions over "interesting tactics" made in the heat of the moment. It has been thrilling and breathless. After 12 rounds Lewis Hamilton leads Sebastian Vettel by 24 points.
